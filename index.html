      <p class="about-text">
        I'm a guy from Finland who graduated from XAMK in 2018 where I studied
        programming. My main focus during studying was game programming but I
        have since then branched out to learn about other fields such as web
        development! After I graduated I have worked in various places doing
        things like game development, technical support and customer service.
        You can find more about it in my CV. Here's some other fun info about
        me:

      <p>I had a dog called Everest üê∂:</p>

        alt="Picture of my dog Everest"
        class="responsive-img"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <p class="pet-description">
        Sadly we had to say goodbye to Everest on 16.10.2022. We all miss him
        dearly.
      </p>
      <p>I also have a cat called Apsi üê±:</p>
      <img
        src="img/Apsi_1.jpg"
        alt="Picture of my cat Apsi"
        class="responsive-img"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <p class="pet-description">
        Apsi is a 5 years old male domestic short-haired cat who likes to be a
        nuisance. He has destroyed 3 ethernet cables so far.
