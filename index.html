      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a guy from Finland who graduated from XAMK in 2018 where I studied
        programming. My main focus during studying was game programming but I
        have since then branched out to learn about other fields such as web
        development! After I graduated I have worked in various places doing
        things like game development, technical support and customer service.
        You can find more about it in my CV. Here's some other fun info about
        me:

      <p>I have a dog called Everest 🐶:</p>

        alt="Picture of my dog Everest"
        class="responsive-img"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <p>
        Everest is a 12 years old male drever. When he's not sleeping he's about
        to fall asleep.

      <p>I also have a cat called Apsi 🐱:</p>
      <img

        alt="Picture of my cat Apsi"
        class="responsive-img"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <p>
        Apsi is a 5 years old male domestic short-haired cat who likes to be a
        nuisance. He has destroyed 3 ethernet cables so far.
