        I'm a guy from Finland who graduated from XAMK in 2018 where I studied
        programming. My main focus during studying was game programming but I
        have since then branched out to learn about other fields such as web
        development! After I graduated I have worked in various places doing
        things like game development, technical support and customer service.
        You can find more about it in my CV. Here's some other fun info about
        me:

        to fall asleep.
